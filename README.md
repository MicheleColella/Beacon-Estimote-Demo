# Beacon Estimote Demo
This repository contains a Swift demo to calculate the distance of Estimote beacons and provide feedback through vibration. The code utilizes Core Location APIs for beacon detection and interaction. The demo continuously detects beacon signal strength, calculates the distance, and activates vibration accordingly. It's a useful example for understanding beacon interaction and implementing sensory feedback in beacon-based iOS applications.
